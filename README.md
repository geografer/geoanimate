# Geonarrator: Maps that Talk #
The goal of this project is to make it easy to "narrate" your way through a map created with d3.js. To that end, it enables easy panning and zooming of a d3 SVG based on the playback status of an HTML 5 audio file.

# Status #
The project started as a class project back in 2014 and was recently restored to working order in late 2017. Major revisions to allow for enhanced customization, easier setup and better out-of-the-box functionality are coming soon.
